Hello, my name is V.A. and this is a site dedicated to some projects I have done, and it is meant to be used as a portfolio. I work as a CFD engineer and I enjoy running, climbing, reading and programming, among other interest. This site is meant to be some kind of outlet for my creative side that I have not nourished enough since my teen years.
