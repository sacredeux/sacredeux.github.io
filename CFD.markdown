The science of fluid dynamics has a long history, dating back to at least the time of [Archimedes of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes), who discovered the principle of buoyancy and famously exclaimed “Eureka!”. Fast forward circa 2000 years, and [Claude-Louis Navier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude-Louis_Navier) and [George Stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Stokes) independently formulated what we now call the Navier–Stokes equations—the conservation of momentum for a Newtonian fluid. The continuity equation, representing conservation of mass, is often included as part of this system. These equations are quite tricky to solve analytically, in fact, they constitute one of the million-dollar problems defined by the Clay Institute of Mathematics, in company with other puzzles which solving would have a big impact on science. While no analytical solution has been found, the equations can be discretized and solved approximately, which is called Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and it is my main area of work. 

Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on that explore different aspects of these equations and their numerical solutions.

### Atmospheric flow on wind turbine
This project was my bachelor's thesis. It focused on the impact of forests on wind turbines, and specifically
